- The first problem is a spelling error in the word "fuctions", which should be spelled "functions". To fix this, you can simply replace the word with the correct spelling.
- The second problem is a grammar error in the sentence "Add F and b functions as functions that can be called by page". The word "functions" is being used in the wrong form, as it should be plural. To fix this, you can rewrite the sentence to properly use the plural form of the word "function".
- The third problem is also a spelling error, this time in the word "function". To fix this, you can simply replace the word with the correct spelling.
- The fourth problem is a suggestion from Grammarly to improve the word choice in the sentence "It stupid old fashioned menu thingy". While this is a valid suggestion, it is a matter of personal preference and may not be applicable to all contexts. You can choose to accept or reject this suggestion as you see fit.

With these problems fixed, the resulting code should look like this:

```markdown
It stupid old fashioned menu thingy

Add F and b functions as functions that can be called by page.

# admin_me

Usage of admin_me:

```text

  -action string
        Action to perform [clean message tidy catalog] (default "clean")

  -debug
        Debug Mode (default true)

  -message string
        Type of message [up, heartbeat, other, message]

  -title string
        Title of message

  -body string
        Body of message
```
```

Is this the correct output? If not, please provide the correct output and I will fix the code again.
